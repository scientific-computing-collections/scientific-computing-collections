# scientific-computing-collections

 Collect solutions for any specific scientific-computing problems. 

## Motivations 
  We already have enormous libraries for scientific computing, for example `numpy` `scipy` `matplotlib` `pandas` in Python, `Eigen` `Blas` in C or Fortran and `matlab toolbox`. Those libraries offer  we researchers a convinent startpoint when solving some specific scientific problem. However, our intelligent efforts are then buried deeply in the harddisk.  Latecomers encounter the same or similiar problems and code again...  That's rolling ! Conflict with human evolution where such knowledges should be recorded and easily acquired by the next generation. 

  So we come up with this idea to make a collection of such solutions. We are not building a common platform like `numpy` or `scipy` or `blas`, instead we are end-users, we use them to solve problems. We are `problem-oriented`.  

## Call for Contributions 
Anyone who share his or her inteligence is appreciated, and we welcome extensions or modification or fixes of individual projects in this collection. 

The program is still at the beginning, PLEASE `fork` and send your `pull request` ~~ 


## Pull Request policy
#### Case 1: commit your own project
1. Create a new folder for your project.
2. Edit your `readme.md` file or other format under your project folder, 
   * verify `problem descriptions`(latex maybe used) 
   * the necessary `environment`(platform, versions of libraries,...) 
   * how to use your code 
3. Optional: add docstring in your code to help comprehend. 


We emphasize only your `ideas` in such problem and the `readability of code`. DONOT worry, just PR! 

#### Case 2: modifications to existent project 
Open an `issue` for your findings or questions or bug-report, send a `pull request` if you already solved it !
